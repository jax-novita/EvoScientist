"""Async container graph for expert-skill dispatch.

One generic graph that reads ``skill_name`` from initial state and loads
that expert skill's actor definition as the sub-agent's system prompt at
invocation time — its ``AGENTS.md`` body under the current skill contract,
or its ``SKILL.md`` body for legacy ``type: expert`` skills. Registered once
in ``langgraph.json``; parameterised per run via the payload the main
agent's ``start_async_task`` passes through
:class:`EvoScientist.middleware.expert_async_subagent.EvoAsyncSubAgentMiddleware`.

Why one shared graph rather than one graph per expert: the per-expert
alternative (each expert registered statically in ``langgraph.json``)
doesn't scale to ``skill_manager install <expert>`` at runtime, because a
new expert would need a repo edit + a langgraph dev restart. The
generic-container approach preserves the "installable async expert"
story.

State schema
------------
Extends ``DeepAgentState`` with ``skill_name`` and ``output_path`` as
optional keys. Both arrive via the ``payload`` the main agent passes; the
middleware validates presence and halts with a clear error message when
either is missing (rather than falling back to an ambient default that
would silently produce the wrong survey).
